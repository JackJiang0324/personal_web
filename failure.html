      <p><strong>Life is the process of getting up from failure </strong></p>
      <p>The small portion of success and the majority of failures have shaped who I am today. Failure has taught me: resilience, humility, perseverance, optimism, and the belief that by warming my left hand with my right, tomorrow will be better.</p>
      <p>Welcome to a list of my professional and personal failures, rejections, and disappointments. started in June 2023.</p>

        <summary>English with accent.</summary>
        <p>
          Sometimes I just feel ashamed when I try but can't imitate a native accent.(weird psychology)
          Nobody cares about you anyway.

        <summary>Didn't get an interview for a job.</summary>
        <p>
          I sent out two hundred resumes and also worked on side projects, but sometimes things just don't work out (and they had a lot of applicants).
          I now understand that connection is the key when everyone's skills are similar.
          In an industry where competition is fierce, it's important to bet on the next big thing.

        <summary>I confessed to the girl I had a crush on for three years before graduation, and she deleted my contact information.</summary>
        <p>
          She is intelligent, decisive, optimistic and beautiful. I am not good enough for her.
          I understand now that confessing is the last step to becoming a couple. Intimate relationships should start from being friends.
          If you like someone, you should subtly let them know as early as possible.

        <summary>Rejected by RUC</summary>
        <p>
          I didn't achieve the ideal score in the college entrance examination.
          I understand now that one exam won't determine my whole life.
          However, it will change my life according to butterfly effect.

        <summary>Rejected by CS program of Uwaterloo</summary>
        <p>
          I didn't demonstrate exceptional talent in computer science though I spent most of the time preparing college entrance examination.
          I understand that choice is more important than ability.

<!--          Sometimes you won't measure up and sometimes it's just not meant to be, and both of those things are okay! So many factors go into decisions like these and it's hard not knowing why I got rejected from some of these programs... but we're worth so much more than our material accomplishments.-->

<!--          I made <a href="https://twitter.com/_joicetang_/status/1488981893282361345?s=20&amp;t=_el8b_VpNCyhDYVRywABeg">blackout poetry with some of my rejection letters</a>, if you're interested.-->

<!--            I was super excited about running this conference with one of my good friends about a year ago, but things went downhill after COVID-19 forced a change of plans. I learned that it's okay to just let go sometimes, and that there are costs to taking on too much &#45;&#45; not only for myself, but for others (like our team, and the people who may have been looking forward to the event).-->

<!--            2) A basic understanding needs to be supplemented with practice, at least for math classes.-->
<!--            3) Don't take 2 math classes at the same time, especially during a pandemic.-->

<!--        <summary>Never finished the Stanford ML course on Coursera</summary>-->
<!--        <p>-->
<!--            I could technically still finish this, but I'm so behind that I've forgotten everything I've learned so far. I think I had a hard time because I hadn't yet taken matrix algebra, and honestly, I've never really seen myself as someone who'd be good at ML. I ended up taking an applied machine learning course in school. I enjoyed it a lot more AND it was more applicable to the work I do, so I think sometimes you just need to figure out what works for you!-->
